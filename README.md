# blockLASSO
Example code and scripts for running a block-by-block LASSO algorithm with the goal of generating polygenic scores.

#before running
This initial version of the code is focused on
(1) only running and scoring the actual block lasso (i.e., no filtering phenotypes, building testing/training sets, covariate analyses and residual phenotypes, etc.
(2) the blocks are assumed to be entire chromosomes.
